# Handup

Day 8 of 40 for 40, built live on Twitch on Wednesday 11 November 2026. The problem is "Sudden mass layoffs", from Lawrence. Work is tracked on the Superthread `day8` board and the "Day 8" page.

- **Form factor:** WhatsApp or iMessage.
- **Name:** Handup, served at `build40for40.com/handup/` once it has a web-facing part.

Shared 40 for 40 context lives in `../AGENTS.md`.

## The problem

Yesterday, while we were building Poppy, my wife called me unexpectedly. The entire company of Fortis Games shut down and the reports say 440 people will lose their jobs. How can we help?

## Direction

Handup is a "laid-off wedding list": a list of in-kind support that someone who just lost their job can share with friends and family, who pick things off it. Think the loan of a laptop, a desk to work from, a lift to an interview or a practice interview. No money is exchanged in the MVP: nothing is paid through Handup, and nothing on a list is something a friend has to buy or pay for. So no pooled funds, donations, payments, bills or subscriptions.

**Who it's for:** mid-career people with real outgoings (a mortgage, kids) who are new to AI, from the day they're laid off to about two weeks later. That's when they're in shock and need practical help fast, like cutting outgoings and keeping a laptop and a place to work.

**How it works:**

- The user talks to an AI agent in a chat app. The agent builds their list with them, starting from a starter pack of about 10 common things.
- There is no web list in the MVP. The list lives in the chat. The agent gives the user a ready-made message to copy and paste to friends, family and groups.
- Updates come back through the user: they tell the agent who has covered what, or forward it the message, and it ticks the item off, gives them a short thank-you to paste and offers one next ask. It doesn't send the whole list again after every tick.
- The landing page just shows the chat flow.

**MVP:**

- Users are identified by phone number.
- Store each user's conversation, profile and list, plus the system prompt with the starter pack.
- Keep memory simple, such as one file per user that gets compacted. Smarter long-term memory can come later.
- A provider's agent development kit (ADK) might host the agent and its long-term memory. That's still being researched.

**Open question: WhatsApp or iMessage.** WhatsApp can't post into existing groups, and nobody wants another Meta approval process. iMessage looks easier but is less documented.

**Ruled out:** a money circle or community emergency fund (money is too hard), an identity mood board, an end-to-end job loss product, a WhatsApp job search agent, warm intros from a LinkedIn export, local support groups, a brag book, and finding fractional or consulting clients.

## The agent

The agent's aim, the user story and the draft system prompt are in `docs/agent-prompt.md`. The prompt names no tools yet, because the ADK is not chosen.
